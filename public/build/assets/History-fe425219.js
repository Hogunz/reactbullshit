Despite having only 20 computers, Computronix successfully transformed its 14 pioneer students into experts.

            However, the triumph faced challenges in the following years. On February 18, 1988, a devastating fire consumed Vina Theatre, located next to the rented building, affecting Computronix. Then, on July 16, 1990, a destructive earthquake struck Dagupan, causing widespread damage to businesses and schools, including Computronix.

            Despite these adversities, Computronix remained unwavering in its mission, demonstrating resilience in the face of tragedy.

            On December 22, 1992, Computronix rapidly ascended to new heights as a collegiate institution, achieving remarkable success shortly after its establishment.

            Within its initial decade, Computronix College accomplished the construction of three buildings – namely, the Felisa Arzadon Memorial Edifice (FAME), the Science Centrum, and the Liberal Arts, Commerce, and Accountancy (LCA) Building. These structures were erected to accommodate the growing number of enrollees and to ensure the provision of quality services as the institution expanded its program offerings.`},{year:"1995 - 2004",decade:"2ND DECADE",title:"Expansion & Recognition",content:`In its second decade, Computronix College expanded its campus by adding new buildings like Engineering, Administration, VPA-CS, and a new LCA Building to accommodate the growing student population and provide additional facilities.

            In 1997, the college was honored as the cleanest and greenest higher educational institution at the city level by the city government, in recognition of its commitment to eco-friendly initiatives.

            During these years, Computronix attained accreditations from The Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities Commission on Accreditation (PACUCOA) for the majority of its offered programs.`},{year:"2005 - 2014",decade:"3RD DECADE",title:"Rebranding & Excellence",content:`In the beginning of its following decade, Computronix College underwent a noteworthy transformation, rebranding itself as Colegio de Dagupan and adopting the new motto "Dat Deus Et Laborant Homines" (God's Given Gifts Developed by Man).

            This strategic change propelled CdD to greater heights, marked by notable achievements and recognitions positioning itself among the region's esteemed higher education institutions.

            In November 2006, CDD underwent CHED's Institutional Quality Assurance Monitoring and Evaluation (IQuAME), earning the esteemed Category A classification, the highest in its category.

            The College of Information and Computing Studies received the Center of Development in Information Technology in March 2007, solidifying its commitment to quality instruction, advanced research, and relevant outreach programs.

            In June 2008, CDD marked a significant achievement with its first topnotcher in the Nursing Licensure Exams – Ms. Rizza A. Tamayo, who ranked 6th, opening the floodgates for the growing names on the HOT (Home of Topnotchers) list.

            The institution's excellence continued to shine as it obtained Deregulated Status in 2009, followed by recognition as a Center of Development for Teacher Education the subsequent year. The pinnacle came in July 2012 when Autonomous Status was granted to Colegio de Dagupan, a testament to its consistently exemplary performance.`},{year:"2015 - 2024",decade:"4TH DECADE",title:"University Status & Global Reach",content:`The commencement of Colegio de Dagupan's fourth decade made a resounding impact in October 2015. During this historic moment, the institution achieved a remarkable feat in the field of Accountancy as two of its Bachelor of Science in Accountancy graduates secured the first and eighth positions in the 2015 Certified Public Accountant Licensure Exams. Rally S. Paragas emerged as the topnotcher, claiming the first position, while Fern Adriel M. Velasco earned the eighth spot. Mr. Paragas marked a significant milestone by becoming the first topnotcher in the CPA licensure exams from the City of Dagupan and the Province of Pangasinan, adding another exceptional achievement to the legacy of Colegio de Dagupan.

            Furthermore, CdD achieved a remarkable accomplishment in the Electronics Engineering Licensure Exams by producing four topnotchers in just three consecutive years. In 2017, Engr. Ronnie Gee G. Alfonso secured 6th place. Engr. Ferren M. Velasco attained 8th place in 2018. Then, in 2019, both Engr. Hannah Joy Fadullon and Engr. Cherish Ferrer achieved top rankings, with Fadullon clinching the second spot and Ferrer securing the seventh.

            For a continuous span of 12 years, Colegio de Dagupan (CDD) consistently produced topnotchers in various Philippine licensure exams. Unfortunately, this impressive 12-year streak was interrupted due to the implementation of the K to 12 program in the country, coupled with the disruptions caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, which led to the suspension of licensure exams.

            After a two-year hiatus, the institution resumed its legacy of producing topnotchers. In April 2022, Engineer Franz Fernand M. Velasco secured the 4th position in the Electronics Engineer Licensure Exam and the 2nd position in the Electronics Technician Licensure Exam. This marked a noteworthy revival of CdD's tradition of excellence in licensure exams.

            On December 14, 2021, Colegio de Dagupan reached a momentous milestone as it was granted university status by the Commission on Higher Education. Consequently, the institution transitioned into Universidad de Dagupan, and invested its founder, Dr. Voltaire P. Arzadon, as its first University President. This signaled a trajectory of sustained growth and development in the years ahead.

            Shortly after attaining university status, UDD embarked on a journey toward internationalization, recognizing the paramount importance of providing students with a global education. The university has actively fostered partnerships and collaborations with institutions worldwide, facilitating exchange programs, joint research projects, and international internships.

            In its commitment to enriching the student learning experience, UDD underwent renovations and established new facilities.

Upgraded classrooms, laboratories, libraries, and other amenities now provide students with essential resources for both academic and personal development. This investment in education underscores the university's unwavering commitment to delivering quality education and ensuring that students have access to the best possible resources.

            In March 2023, Dr. Feliza Arzadon-Sua, formerly the Vice President for Academic Affairs, assumed the role of UdD's new president, succeeding her father. She persistently strengthens essential connections to propel the school's trajectory towards achieving world-class status.

            December 2024 marks another milestone for Universidad de Dagupan as it receives the ISO 21001:2018 certification, a globally recognized standard for Educational Organizations Management Systems. This achievement makes UdD the first institution in Region 1 to earn this prestigious distinction. The underscores the university’s commitment to delivering quality education and fostering excellence.
